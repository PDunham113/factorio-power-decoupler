# factorio-power-decoupler
High-discharge low-capacity accumulator for decoupling Factorio electric
networks

## Overview
This mod adds an accumulator with significantly increased charge/discharge speed
(2.5 MW default) and significantly decreased capacity (50 kJ default). The intent
is to allow for more compact accumulator-isolation of less critical factory
sectors (see [wiki][]).
